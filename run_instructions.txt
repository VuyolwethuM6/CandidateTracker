To run the CandidateTracker application and see the race-gender specific targets:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd C:\Users\Vuyo\Downloads\CandidateTracker\CandidateTracker

3. Run the Flask application:
   python main.py

4. Open a web browser and go to:
   http://localhost:5000

5. You should see the dashboard with:
   - The original metrics cards (Total Candidates, Female Candidates, PWD Candidates)
   - A new "Race Targets Progress" section showing cards for each race-gender combination
   - Each card shows the current count, target, and progress percentage
   - The Race Distribution chart now shows a stacked bar chart with gender breakdown by race

The implementation includes:
- Race-gender specific targets defined in app.py
- Backend logic to calculate progress against these targets
- Frontend components to display the targets and progress
- Enhanced race chart showing gender breakdown within each race category

If you encounter any issues:
- Make sure all required packages are installed (flask, pandas, numpy)
- Check the console for any error messages
- Verify that there is data in the data directory
