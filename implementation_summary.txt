# Race-Gender Specific Targets Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've enhanced the CandidateTracker application to track and display race-gender specific targets. This implementation allows monitoring progress against specific targets for different race and gender combinations, such as African Male, African Female, Coloured Male, etc.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (app.py)
- Added race-gender specific targets definition:
```python
RACE_TARGETS = {
    'African Male': 230,
    'African Female': 435,
    'Coloured Male': 32,
    'Coloured Female': 61,
    'Indian Male': 15,
    'Indian Female': 27
}
```

- Enhanced the `get_dashboard_metrics` function to:
  - Create a combined Race_Gender field from Race and Gender columns
  - Calculate counts for each race-gender combination
  - Calculate progress percentages against the defined targets
  - Return this data in the API response

### 2. Frontend Changes (home.html)
- Added a new "Race Targets Progress" section to the dashboard:
```html
<div class="row mb-4">
    <div class="col-12">
        <div class="card shadow-sm">
            <div class="card-header bg-transparent border-0">
                <h5 class="mb-0">Race Targets Progress</h5>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <div class="row" id="race-targets-container">
                    <!-- Race target cards will be populated here by JavaScript -->
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### 3. JavaScript Changes (dashboard.js)
- Added a new `updateRaceTargets` function to create and display cards for each race-gender target:
  - Shows the target value
  - Shows current count
  - Displays progress percentage
  - Color-codes progress bars (red, yellow, green)

- Enhanced the `updateRaceChart` function to:
  - Check if race-gender data is available
  - Fall back to the original pie chart if detailed data is not available
  - Create a stacked bar chart showing gender breakdown within each race
  - Use different colors for male and female segments

## Benefits
- More detailed diversity tracking
- Visual representation of progress against specific race-gender targets
- Better insights into the demographic composition of candidates
- Ability to identify specific areas that need improvement

## Future Enhancements
- Add filtering capabilities to view race-gender data by program
- Implement trend analysis to track changes over time
- Add export functionality for race-gender specific reports
- Create dedicated page for detailed diversity analytics
